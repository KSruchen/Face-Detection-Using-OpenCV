# Face Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV and a Haar Cascade classifier. It utilizes your webcam to detect faces in the video stream and draws green rectangles around detected faces.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect frontal faces.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** library (to install, run the following command):
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
